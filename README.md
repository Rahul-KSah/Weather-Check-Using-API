# Weather-Check-Using-API
I'm excited to present the 𝐖𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐀𝐩𝐩 I've designed and developed using 𝐇𝐓𝐌𝐋, 𝐂𝐒𝐒, and 𝐉𝐚𝐯𝐚𝐒𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭. 🌤️ This app not only provides live weather updates but also offers additional features such as 𝘞𝘪𝘯𝘥 𝘚𝘱𝘦𝘦𝘥 measurement and 𝘏𝘶𝘮𝘪𝘥𝘪𝘵𝘺 tracking.
By leveraging an 𝐀𝐏𝐈, the Weather App delivers accurate and up-to-date information to keep you informed about the weather conditions in your area. ☀️⛅️🌧️❄️ Whether you're planning outdoor activities, preparing for a trip, or simply curious about the forecast, this app has got you covered!
Key features of the Weather App:
🔹 Real-time weather updates: Stay up to date with the latest weather information.
🔹 Wind speed monitoring: Check the current wind speed for your location.
🔹 Humidity tracking: Stay informed about the humidity levels in your area.

I'm incredibly proud of the effort and creativity invested in this project. The Weather App showcases my skills in web development and demonstrates my ability to seamlessly integrate external APIs. 🚀
Please take a moment to explore the Weather App and share your feedback. Your input is invaluable and will help me further refine and enhance the app.
If you have any questions, suggestions, or would like to collaborate on similar projects, please don't hesitate to reach out. I am always open to new opportunities and ideas.
Thank you for your continued support! 🙏 Let's stay weather-ready together! ☔️☀️❄️
